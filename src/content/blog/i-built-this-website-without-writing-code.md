I'm a 787 pilot, not a developer.

But I just built this entire website without writing a single line of code myself.

No WordPress. No templates. No drag-and-drop builder.

Just me, AI, and a few hours of experimenting.

Here's exactly how I did it, what worked, what didn't, and why this changes everything.

## Why I Didn't Use WordPress

I've used WordPress before. It works. But it always felt like I was renting my website, not owning it.

Every plugin is a potential breaking point. Every update risks something going wrong. Want a simple feature? Pay $49/year for a plugin. Want it to load fast? Pay for premium hosting.

I wanted something different:
- Full control over every aspect
- Lightning fast performance
- Zero bloat
- Free hosting
- Easy to update

Most importantly, I wanted something AI agents could eventually manage for me.

The goal isn't just to build a website. The goal is to build a website that an AI agent can update when I text it from 38,000 feet.

That meant starting with clean, modern code that AI understands perfectly.

## The Stack I Chose

After researching options, here's what I landed on:

**Astro** - A static site generator that creates incredibly fast websites. Pages load instantly because they're pre-built HTML. No heavy JavaScript frameworks slowing things down.

**Tailwind CSS** - For styling. Instead of writing custom CSS, you add classes directly to elements. It's fast, modern, and AI handles it perfectly.

**Vercel** - Free hosting that deploys automatically when I push to GitHub. Changes go live in 30 seconds.

**Claude Code** - An AI coding assistant that lives inside VS Code. I describe what I want, and it writes all the code.

**GitHub** - Version control. Every change is tracked. I can roll back if something breaks (though nothing has yet).

Total cost: $0/month.

## How I Actually Built It

Here's the honest timeline.

**Hour 1: From Zero to Live Website**

I installed the tools (Node.js, VS Code, Claude Code, GitHub Desktop). Never used a terminal before, but the installers walked me through everything.

Then I opened Claude Code and typed:

"Create a new Astro website with Tailwind CSS. Dark theme. Teal accents. Make it look modern and professional."

Claude built the entire thing in 2 minutes.

I pushed it to GitHub. Connected Vercel. Clicked deploy.

**The site was live before I went to bed.**

That's it. One hour from "I should build a website" to a live, professional site on the internet.

**The Next Morning: Adding Content**

I spent 30 minutes playing around with prompts:

- "Add a blog section"
- "Create a videos page for my YouTube content"
- "Add my first blog post about [topic]"
- "Upload this video and create a page for it"

Every change went live in 30 seconds. Just push to GitHub and Vercel rebuilds automatically.

By lunchtime, I had:
- A complete blog with my first article published
- A videos section showcasing my YouTube content
- Custom domain pointing to the site
- Everything looking exactly how I wanted

**Total time invested: 90 minutes.**

Not days. Not weeks. An hour and a half.

## What Actually Worked

**1. AI wrote 100% of the code**

I never touched JavaScript, CSS, or HTML directly. I just described what I wanted. Claude handled the implementation.

**2. Changes are instant**

Want to update something? Tell Claude. Push to GitHub. Live in 30 seconds.

No FTP uploads. No cache clearing. No manual deployments.

**3. It's fast. Really fast.**

Pages load in under 200ms. No bloat. No unnecessary JavaScript. Just clean, pre-built HTML.

Google PageSpeed scores are in the 90s across the board.

**4. I actually understand my own site**

Because I watched Claude build everything, I know how it works. I can read the code. I know where everything is.

Compare that to WordPress, where good luck figuring out which plugin is causing that random error.

**5. Zero ongoing costs**

No hosting fees. No plugin subscriptions. No premium theme licenses.

Just a domain name ($12/year).

## What Didn't Work (At First)

**Typography broke**

Blog posts looked terrible at first. Just plain text with no formatting.

Turns out I needed to install a Tailwind plugin for prose styling. Claude walked me through it. Fixed in 5 minutes.

**Robots.txt had a placeholder URL**

Google Search Console couldn't read my sitemap because robots.txt still said "yourdomain.com" instead of "rossstarkey.com."

Simple fix, but it took me a day to notice.

**I caught the site mid-deploy once**

Opened it in Chrome and everything looked broken. Panicked for a second.

Turns out Vercel was rebuilding the site. Tried incognito mode 30 seconds later and it was fine.

**Small hiccups, easy fixes.**

Nothing broke catastrophically. Nothing required developer intervention. Claude helped me fix everything.

## The Real Breakthrough

Here's what I didn't expect.

Building the site was cool. But the real breakthrough is what comes next.

This isn't just a website. It's a foundation for AI automation.

The plan:
1. Build the website (done)
2. Set up AI agents to manage it
3. Text an agent: "Add a blog post about X"
4. The agent writes the post, pushes to GitHub, and it's live

I'll be able to update my website from anywhere. Even from 38,000 feet over the Atlantic.

No laptop. No code editor. Just a text message.

That's the end goal. And I'm already halfway there.

## Who This Approach Is For

This isn't for everyone.

If you want a drag-and-drop builder where you move boxes around, use Squarespace or Wix.

If you want a massive plugin ecosystem, stick with WordPress.

But if you want:
- Full control over your site
- Lightning-fast performance
- Zero ongoing costs
- A foundation for AI automation
- To actually understand how your site works

Then this approach changes everything.

You don't need to be technical. You just need to be willing to try something new.

## The Bottom Line

I built a professional website in 90 minutes.

Zero code written by me. Zero monthly fees. Zero compromises.

It loads faster than any WordPress site I've ever built. It's easier to update. And I actually own it.

Most importantly, it's the foundation for what I'm building next: a website managed entirely by AI agents.

That's the future I'm betting on.

Not because it's trendy. Because I've seen it work.
